# burgermenu
"Burger/dropdown" style responsive menu created with HTML/CSS
 
 
Hi & welcome to my dropdown nav component, I made this in order to get a better understanding of how transitions work so i can do cool little animations without having to rely on javascript, though admittedly i ended up having to use some in the end to make things responsive but i still feel like making this app has been a beneficial experience.

Feel free to use it in your own projects.
